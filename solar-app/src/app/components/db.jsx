Mercury is also the smallest planet in our system, being only slightly larger than Earth's own moon. "

Mars holds the title for having the biggest mountain in the solar system, the gargantuan shield Volcano Olympus Mons, three times higher than Everest."

        "description": "The king of the planets, Jupiter is a gas giant and by far the largest planet in the Solar System. It contains more than twice the mass of all the other planets combined! In fact Jupiter had star potential but lacked the mass and pressure to acheive a fusion reaction in it's core to fully ignite into one. Though massive, it would still need at least 13 times the mass to become the smallest of stars. As a gas giant Jupiter lacks a true surface, but the swirling gases and liquids, mixed with extreme pressures, temperatures, gravity and winds makes it a very unlikely destination for exploration."

Saturn has the most moons in the solar system, with 146 currently recognised. It also has a spectacular ring system, making it uniquely beautiful. A funny fact about Saturn is that it isn't very dense, and if one were to find a bathtub on a galactic scale you would find that Saturn would actually float."

        "description": "A distant cold and windy and planet, Uranus is an 'Ice Giant' and the majority of its mass made up of icy fluids. Uranus has a unique tilt to it, its axis of rotation being 90 degress from the plane of its orbit, making it appear to spin on its side. It also has a faint ring system, though not as spectacular as Saturn's. It's blue-green colour is caused by the large amounts of Methane in it's atmosphere. The distance of these outer planets can be hard to comprehend, Uranus is almost 20 times the distance to the Sun than we are, with light taking around 2 hours and 40 minutes to reach it rather than 8 minutes."

        "description": "Dark, cold and scoured by supersonic winds Neptune is a the most distant of the planets in our system, around 30 astronomical units (30 times the distance of the Earth to the Sun). In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165 year orbit since its discovery in 1846. Another ice giant with a bluey color caused by large amounts of Methane, it also has a few small ring structures and is the densest of the giants. ITs famous for its winds, which can reach up to 1200mph. Similar to Uranus, Neptune first formed much closer in to the sun but moved outwards to where it's orbit stabilised around 4 billion years ago."
